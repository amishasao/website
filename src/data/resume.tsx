  summary:
    "In the summer of 2023, I shifted my focus from embedded systems to machine learning and artificial intelligence, while continuing my work to improve technology accessibility. My journey has been shaped by notable achievements such as being named a US Presidential Scholar in 2024 and publishing a paper in IEEE Xplore. I have participated in unique educational experiences, including Sewa International's Design to Lead program, where I worked with Dr. Anurag Mairal, and projects like creating a robotic rehab glove and developing an LSTM neural network for patient movement prediction.\n\nMy professional experience includes a role as a Research Apprentice at UT Austinâ€™s Applied Research Laboratories, where I developed Python scripts to evaluate machine learning models and worked on projects like an AI Document Scanner App. I have also been actively involved in hackathons, leading projects from marketplace websites to health and habit tracker apps.\n\nFrom creating the first in-person hackathon in my city to engaging with experts in the field, I am driven to grow in the niche academic field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In the future, I aim to be an HCI researcher, refining technology and broadening its connection with humanity. Connect with me on LinkedIn and GitHub to explore more about my work and interests!",
